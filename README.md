# Meal Tracker

#### By Sky Rousse

## Description

Epicodus Javascript course week 2 project:

A meal tracking application built with Angular2 that allows users to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories.

## User Stories

* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).

## Objectives

* Does the application work as expected?
Is the app structured in a logical way, including a model, multiple components and * TypeScript? (Interfaces are not required).
* Can the application create and edit new instances of a model?
* Does the app allow you to view a list of foods?
* Can the application filter foods based on their calories?
* Are dependencies managed with npm and Bower?
* Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server?
* Does code meet standards from previous weeks?
* Is the project in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?
* Are you able to discuss the flow of your code and concepts behind it using correct terminology?

## Technologies Used

* node (npm, bower)
* Typescript
* Angular2
* JS
* Sass
